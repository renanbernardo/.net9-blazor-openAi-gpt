    <div class="feature-title">Internal Opportunity Discovery Engine</div>
    <p>
        The Internal Opportunity Discovery Engine is an AI-powered platform feature that continuously analyzes employee profiles, skills, interests, and business needs to proactively match employees with internal opportunities. These opportunities can include open roles, cross-functional projects, mentorships, training programs, or short-term gigs. The engine surfaces “hidden” talent and opportunities, empowering employees to grow and enabling organizations to maximize their existing workforce.

    <h4>Key Capabilities</h4>
    <ul class="feature-list">
        <li>
            <strong>AI-Driven Skill and Interest Mapping:</strong>
            Uses OpenAI to analyze structured data (profiles, resumes, training records) and unstructured data (feedback, project notes, self-descriptions) to build a dynamic, up-to-date map of each employee’s skills, interests, and aspirations. Can process natural language input from employees to update their interests and career goals.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Opportunity Aggregation:</strong>
            Integrates with internal systems (HRIS, project management, learning platforms) to gather available opportunities: open positions, projects, mentorships, and training. Allows managers and HR to post new opportunities directly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Smart Matching and Recommendations:</strong>
            The AI matches employees to opportunities based on skills, interests, past performance, and career goals. Provides personalized recommendations to employees, highlighting opportunities they might not have considered. Surfaces “hidden” talent for managers—employees with relevant but previously unrecognized skills.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Proactive Notifications:</strong>
            Notifies employees and managers about new matches or relevant opportunities. Suggests upskilling or training paths if an employee is close to qualifying for a desired opportunity.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Feedback and Continuous Learning:</strong>
            Learns from employee interactions (e.g., which opportunities are accepted, declined, or ignored) to improve future recommendations. Allows employees to provide feedback on matches to refine the engine.
        </li>
